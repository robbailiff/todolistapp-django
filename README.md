# To Do List App with Django

## Introduction

This project was started as a way for me to better understand the Django web framework built in Python. It is pretty basic and simply allows the user to add and delete tasks from the list which are stored in a database.  I then deployed it to Heroku for the app to be hosted with a database in cloud storage. You can check out the [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/) and the [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) for more information.

## What did I learn?

This was the first project that I have used Django properly and I feel like I now understand the basics of how it works. There are a lot of code snippets in different files that need adding and updating as you build out the app, which are difficult to keep track of at times. I think more practice with the framework with help cement in this knowledge. This was also the first time I have deployed anything to Heroku and it was quite a steep learning curve to make sure all the settings were correct in order for the Django app to function correctly.
